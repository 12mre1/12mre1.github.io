	<p> Welcome to my blog! The reason I write these posts is to provide clear explanations of technical concepts.
	I also find that writing helps clarify my thoughts. I write about many topics from statistics, mathematics, 
	economics and computer science. Many posts only require high-school knowledge of math and computer programming, but when
	advanced prerequisites are needed, I state them in the post header. Most of my programming is written in Python, R 
	or C++ (this is just a consequence of my education). In the spirit of life-long learning, every post contains resources for
	further reading. If you have suggestions for new posts, or improvements to existing ones, please don't hesitate to contact me. </p> 

	<ul class="posts">
