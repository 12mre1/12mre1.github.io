<p>Welcome to my teaching materials page. Full disclosure: I have never formally taught an entire class, 
however I have served as TA on many occasions, where I've gained experience lecturing and running computing labs.
I find teaching very rewarding, and these materials reflect some of what I've taught (and more). All material 
here is solely my own creation, and I don't claim any copyright. Please feel free to distribute if you wish. </p>
