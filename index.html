	<h1>Matthew Edwards</h1>
	<p> Welcome to my professional website! My name's Matt, and I'm a grad student in the <b>Department of Statistical Sciences</b> at the University of Toronto. 
		My current research/coursework focuses on <b>statistical machine learning and simulation</b>. Before coming here I worked for the Government of Canada, 
		after completing Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Economics at Queen's University. For a more detailed bio, please see my resume above. </p>
	
	<p> Below are some of my recent projects, which are mostly on ML and Econ topics. Aside from research, I enjoy technical writing and education (see the blog above). 
		If you'd like to discuss my work (or just want to talk data), feel free to reach out to me (I prefer email, see below). 
		I'll be on the job market in the summer of 2021. </p>


	<h2>Software</h2>
	<p> This section contains larger software projects I've worked on (or am still working on). 
        As is the case with my blog, I write mostly in Python and R, with some C++.</p>
    
    <br>

    <p> <b>geocodR</b> is an R package designed to execute batch geocoding of addresses from CSV input. 
        It uses the GoogleMaps API. You can find the github repo <a href='https://github.com/12mre1/geocodr' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

    <p> <b>mcsim</b> is a python package designed for Monte Carlo simulation. Currently, it has objects for MC integration, 
        and Importance Sampling. You can find the github repo <a href='https://github.com/12mre1/mcsim' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

    <p><a href='https://car-sales-2017.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>Here is a data dashboard</a> based on a car sales dataset from 2017.
    The application is deployed on heroku, and is written mainly with Flask, Plotly and Pandas. You can see my code and the data info
    <a href="https://github.com/12mre1/car-sales-2017" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
