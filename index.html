	<h3>Matthew Edwards</h3>
	<p> Welcome to my website! My name's Matt, and I'm a masters candidate in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.
	My research focuses on statistical machine learning and simulation. Before studying here, I worked as a research analyst for the Government of
	Canada (Employment and Social Development), and as a statistician for Study.com. Before that, I was a research assistant at Queen's University, 
	where I earned bachelor's and master's degrees in economics.</p>
	
	<p> Aside from my research, I enjoy technical writing and education (see the blog above). I'm also working on a game theory textbook.  If you'd 
	like to discuss my research (or just want to talk data), feel free to reach out to me (I prefer email, see below). I'll be on the job market 
	in the new year. </p>
