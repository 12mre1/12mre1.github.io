	<h1>Matthew Edwards</h1>
	<p> Welcome to my professional website! My name's Matt, and I'm a <b>grad student</b> in the <b>Department of Statistical Sciences</b> at the University of Toronto. 
		My current research/coursework focuses on <b>statistical machine learning and simulation. For a more detailed bio, please see my resume above</b>. </p>
	
	

	<p> Below are some of my recent papers/projects, which are mostly on ML and Econ topics. Aside from research, I enjoy technical writing and education (see the blog above). 
		I'm also working on a couple textbooks.  If you'd like to discuss my work (or just want to talk data), feel free to reach out to me (I prefer email, see below). 
		I'll be on the job market in the spring of 2021. </p>
