	<p> Welcome to my professional website! My name's Matt, and I'm a <b>grad student</b> in the <b>Department of Statistical Sciences</b> at the University of Toronto. 
		My current research focuses on <b>statistical machine learning and simulation</b>. </p>
	
	<p>Here's a very short bio:
		<ul>
			<li>Before studying here, I worked as a <b>research analyst</b> for the <b>Government of
				Canada</b> (Employment and Social Development)</li>
			<li>I also worked as a <b>statistician</b> for </b>Study.com</li>
			<li>I have a <b>BAH and MA in Economics</b> from Queen's University, where I also worked as a TA and RA</li>
		</ul>
	More details can be found on my CV (see above).
	</p>

	<p> Aside from research, I enjoy technical writing and education (see the blog above). I'm also working on a couple textbooks.  If you'd 
	like to discuss my work (or just want to talk data), feel free to reach out to me (I prefer email, see below). I'll be on the job market 
	in the spring of 2021. </p>
