	<h1>Matthew Edwards</h1>
	<p> Welcome to my professional website! My name's Matt, and I work as an Economist for the Regional Municipality of York (just north of Toronto). 
	My current work deals mostly with inflation and the labour market. I'm also interested in fiscal and monetary policy (particularly as they relate 
	to consumer inflation). Before starting my current role, I studied statistics at the University of Toronto,  where I focused on statistical machine learning 
	and simulation. Before that I worked as a researcher for the Government of Canada, after studying Economics at Queen's University. For a more detailed bio, 
	please see my resume above. </p>
	
	<p> Below are some of my recent projects, which are mostly on Math and Econ topics. Besides research, I enjoy technical writing and education 
	(see the blog above). If you'd like to discuss my work (or just want to talk data), 
	feel free to reach out to me (I prefer email, see below). </p>


	<h2>Software</h2>
	<p> This section contains larger software projects I've worked on (or am still working on). 
        As is the case with my blog, I write mostly in Python and R, with some C++.</p>

	<ul>

	<li><a href='https://car-sales-2017.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>Here is a data dashboard</a> based on a car sales dataset from 2017.
	The application is deployed on heroku, and is written mainly with Flask, Plotly and Pandas. You can see my code and the data info
	<a href="https://github.com/12mre1/car-sales-2017" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

	<li><b>mcsim</b> is a python package designed for Monte Carlo simulation. Currently, it has objects for MC integration, 
	and Importance Sampling. You can find the github repo <a href='https://github.com/12mre1/mcsim' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>

		<br>

    <li><b>geocodR</b> is an R package designed to execute batch geocoding of addresses from CSV input. 
        It uses the GoogleMaps API. You can find the github repo <a href='https://github.com/12mre1/geocodr' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>    

	</ul>
