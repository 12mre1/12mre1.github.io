## On Cournot vs Bertrand Pricing Models

Today's post is going to be a bit longer than usual, and a bit more theoretical (no code, just math). We're going to take a close look at two types of models used to predict producer (firm) behavior in the marketplace: __Cournot__ and __Bertrand__. Both are named for their inventors, and both model competition among homogeneous firms in a competitive market, however there are advantages and disadvantages to each. We'll discuss the assumptions underlying each, and work through some of the derivations in a game theoretic setting. Here is a rough table of contents:

- Introduction
- Cournot Competition
    - Technical Assumptions
    - Profit Maximization
        - The Cournot Theorem
        - Nash Equilibrium and Best Response Functions
    - Example: Quadratic Costs
    - The Case of Heterogeneous Costs
- Bertrand Competition
    - Technical Assumptions
    - Profit Maximization

## Introduction

Within any industry, the firm must constantly make decisions in order to compete in the market. This note compares two of the earliest models of firm dynamics in a competitive market: __Cournot competition__, and __Bertrand competition__. In the former, firms compete on the basis of quantity produced, while in the latter, they compete on price.
