## The Basic Framework of Reinforcement Learning

_Prerequisite Math: None_

_Prerequisite Coding: None_

This post is dedicated to the basics of __Reinforcement Learning__, which is a subdomain of Machine Learning more generally. Many machine learning techniques involve teaching computers to perform a task by giving the algorithm a series of examples, so the computer can attempt to deduce patterns underlying proper(optimal) behavior. Often (though not always), these examples come with labels made by humans , that allow for evaluative feedback (loss) to guide the machine towards the optimal solution given certain data. However RL operates in a fundamentally different way.  Instead of explicitly teaching the computer using human-driven feedback, we give the reinforcement learning agent a direct connection to its __environment__, so that it may __explore possible strategies through trial and error__. In this sense, RL agents learn from experience, and from this experience can learn to evaluate the consequences of actions.

Because of the sequential nature of environment exploration, and the fact that the agent can have a very large number of interactions through time, the goal of any Reinforcement agent is simply to maximize a __reward signal__ across time. This brings a number of challenges, since the action of the agent early in time may have a large impact on possible future rewards later. Thus, in evaluating possible actions, the agent must somehow think beyond its current situation. In other words, the agent must plan ahead. So how do we formally define such a framework? Fortunately in the RL community, the notation used to define the components I will go through shortly is fairly universal.

I begin here by defining the __action space__ \\( A \\), which is simply the set of all possible actions an agent may take. The set of actions can be remarkably simple - for example in the game of tic-tac-toe, which traditionally uses a 3 x 3 board, your action space will be a set of at most 9 choices. Whatever the agent decides at each step in the sequence, it must be that \\( a_t \in A \\), where \\( t = 1, \cdots, T \\) denotes current period in the sequence. Note that the action space may change as the agent progresses through time. Also the action space can be continuous or discrete. The tic-tac-toe example is discrete (meaning there are a countable number of choices), but in a different scenario - say, the agent must fly a helicoptor in high winds, or learn to walk - the action space can be continuous, or infinite. Note that the actions available to the agent also depend on what has happened up to the current point in the game. How do we keep track of this information? 

Perhaps the most important component in the RL framework is the concept of __state__. The state contains __all the relevent information about what has occurred thusfar__. In some cases, this representation is intuitive - the chess board configuration alone is enough for an agent trying to win the game of chess. But in some cases, the state can be quite subtle. An example that comes to mind here is the robotic manipulation task of picking up and putting down a cup. In this case, prior velocity and position from several previous states may be required to fully inform the agent in the current state. The important thing to note is that the state is the __mechanism through which the agent interacts with the environment__. The state keeps the agent aware of how the game/task changes, which is crucial for understanding the consequences of actions. We similarly denote the state space by \\( S \\). Sometimes the state space is small too. For instance, in tic-tac-toe there are \\( 3^9 \\) possible board configurations, many of which are duplicated by symmetry, so the number of states is around 600. However for larger games like Go, or other tasks like learning to walk, the state space can be very large, or even infinite.

Now, in a perfect world, our RL agent would know exactly which action is best in each possible situation that might occur. In general, we call a mapping from state to action a __policy__, and the goal in any RL task is to find the policy that maximizes reward. We call such a policy the __optimal policy__, and often denote policies in general with the greek letter \\( \pi \\).
