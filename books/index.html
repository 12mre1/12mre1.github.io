<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p> Welcome to my books page! I enjoy technical writing, so what better way to channel that than through textbooks? Just like my blog posts 
(which I encourage you to read), I write books both to give back to the community, and to improve my own understanding. An advantage of the
textbook over the blog is that I can give a more thorough and rigourous treatment of content. Thus, many of my books are quite
lengthy, and contain a wide variety of topics. Consequently I offer each book in its entirety, but also break them up by chapter. All errors
are my own. If you spot a mistake (I'm certainly NOT perfect), please let me know.</p>
  
<h1><b><i> Applied Game Theory </i></b></h1>
  
<p><b>This textbook is a work in progress. Many of the chapters are incomplete. I hope to have a draft completed by Spring 2021. </b></p>

<p> This book does not assume any knowledge of game theory. I found most introductory textbooks to be rather dry and math-heavy, which
 does not help if the reader is looking to use the information outside a math department. I use a more intuitive approach, emphasizing 
 examples to go from beginner to expert (graduate level). The later chapters of the book (ie chapters 12 and up) do use quite a bit of math, 
 and may be skipped if your goal is simply to understand the basics.</p>

<h1><b><i> Handbook of Statistical Distributions </i></b></h1>
  
<p><b> This textbook is a work in progress. Many of the chapters are incomplete. I hope to have a draft completed by Winter 2021.</b></p>

<p>This book is designed to be a quick reference for statisticians or scientists who need to know properties of common data distributions. 
It is certainly useful for inference and modelling, but may also be useful to undergraduate math/stats/econ majors who are just seeing 
mathematical statistics for the first time. I derived most of this in grad school, but it seemed a waste not to compile it. Unlike most graduate
texts, this book does not use measure theory, beyond a hint in the first chapter.</p>
